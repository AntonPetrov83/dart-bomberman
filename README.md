
## Overview

Dart Bomberman is a remake of the original Bomberman game for NES written in Dart for educational purposes.

## Installing and Running

1. Install Dart SDK from [here][http://dartlang.org] (my current version is 1.15.0). Make sure the `/bin` folder is on your `PATH`.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `$ pub serve` from the project root (this is where 'pubspec.yaml' file is).
4. Use your browser to open `http://localhost:8080` (the default port served by the `pub` utility).

Enjoy!
